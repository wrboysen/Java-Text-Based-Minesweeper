This is a project that I completed for my first Java class at Metropolitan Community College. It is a fully functional text based Minesweeper game.

The requirements were as follows:
The game would populate 10 mines no matter the size of the grid.
The user would be asked for a height and width to create the grid from.
The game would use exactly three classes.  Minesweeper, game, and grid.
